# Markov Chains And Mixing Times Annotated

[MCMT book](https://pages.uoregon.edu/dlevin/MARKOV/mcmt2e.pdf) re-written in jupyter notebooks with relevant code to simulate the concepts.

My goal is two-folds:

- Re-write each chapter as I read along to better understand and elaborate with supplementary material wherever I needed (e.g., linear algebra for some proofs).

- Annotate each chapter with simulations to make the material more interactive and visually appealing. 

Main folder is the [lecture_notes](lecture_notes) folder.
